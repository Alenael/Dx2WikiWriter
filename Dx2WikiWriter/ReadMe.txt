Steps to Use:
1. Download the Database's from: https://github.com/Alenael/Dx2DB/tree/master/csv and place it in a folder somewhere and remember where you placed it.
2. Open Dx2 Wiki Writer and Click Load All. Select Load All and when prompted select the folder where you placed the databases from in the previous step.
3. Make changes as needed to the grids for Demons and Skills. Then click Save All to save the files out. 
4. Right Click and Select All for Demons. Then click Export All Demons and Export Individual Demons.
5. Repeat the step above but for Skills as well.
6. Visit the folder where you placed your Database's and now you should see a Skill Data and Demon Data folder with text files. Each of these text files contains the information that needs to be used on the Wiki page.
